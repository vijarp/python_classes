"""Encapsulation and Getters/Setters
Modify the Car class to make the year attribute private. Add a method to get the value of year and another method to set the value of year, ensuring that it can only be set to a value greater than or equal to 1886 (the year the first car was invented).

Task:
Modify the Car class to make year a private attribute.
Add a getter method called get_year to retrieve the year.
Add a setter method called set_year to set the year, with validation to ensure itâ€™s greater than or equal to 1886.
Create an instance of the Car class and test setting and getting the year.
